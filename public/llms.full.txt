# Walk the Valley - Healthcare Innovation Podcast
## Full Documentation for AI Systems

### Website Overview
Walk the Valley is a bi-monthly podcast that bridges the gap between healthcare innovation and commercialization. The podcast features real-world advice from healthcare innovation entrepreneurs navigating the challenging journey from discovery to market.

### Mission
Healthcare innovation is complex, and many promising ideas never reach commercialization. Most healthcare innovations originate in research labs, driven by scientists who excel in discovery but often lack experience in building commercial frameworks. Walk the Valley provides practical guidance to support aspiring scientific entrepreneurs through the "valley of death" - the critical phase where promising discoveries often fail to reach commercialization.
